---> Technologies: Java, SQLite (Room), MVVM Architecture, LiveData, RecyclerView, SharedPreferences, Notifications, Charts (MPAndroidChart)
---> Developed a fully functional Android application designed to track daily expenses and manage monthly budgets, utilizing modern Android development best practices and tools.
---> Key features include:
    1) Expense Management: Implemented CRUD operations for managing expenses (add, edit, delete) using Room database with a custom ExpenseDao for efficient database queries
    2) Budget Tracking & Notifications: Added monthly budget tracking functionality with real-time expense monitoring. Integrated local notifications to alert users when they exceed their budget limit.
    3) Data Visualization: Incorporated visual representations of spending data using MPAndroidChart, including pie charts for category-based spending and bar charts for monthly expense summaries.
    4) Advanced Search & Filters: Implemented search functionality to filter expenses by category, description, and date range, improving user experience and ease of tracking.
    5) Offline Data Storage: Leveraged Room Persistence Library for local SQLite database management, ensuring data remains accessible offline and synchronized across app sessions.
    6) Clean Architecture: Followed the MVVM architecture pattern with LiveData to separate UI from business logic, ensuring maintainable and scalable code.
